# README Status Badge Generator

A tiny, no-dependency tool to generate status badges for project READMEs.

## Why

Projects change state.
READMEs rarely do.

This tool makes project status visible.

## Usage

1. Enter a project name
2. Select a status
3. Copy the generated markdown
4. Paste into your README

## Statuses

- Active
- Experimental
- Paused
- Archived

## Philosophy

Small tools.
Clear signals.
No dashboards.
